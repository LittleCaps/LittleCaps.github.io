# Overview

The task contains six main stages,

1. **events**: preliminary tasks, source-independent calibrations
2. **angles**: aspect-drift corrections
3. **filter**: filter events and exposure
4. **spectra**: generate spectra
5. **fluxing**: generate response matrices and flux the spectra
6. **lightcurve**: generate light curves

## 1. Stage One: "events"

### 1.1 atthkgen

Creates the attitude time-series file. This step is skipped if the file already exists in the current working directory.

### 1.2 attfilter

Creates the attitude-drift GTI as filtering of the attitude time-series over the duration of the exposure being processed.

### 1.3 hkgtigen

Analyzes the ODF housekeeping data to determine the basic set of housekeeping GTI for each instrument.

#### 1.3.1 rgsoffsetcalc

(To force construction of fresh offsets the user must manually delete this file before running rgsproc.)

#### 1.3.2 rgssources

Creates the soure list and adds to it the SRCLIST table.

If you want to add more sources, just use rgssources, do not restart rgsproc.

#### 1.3.3 rgsframes

creates the intermediate event lists and adds to them the PIXELS and EXPOSURE tables, adn an internally generated GTI table called STDGTI.

#### 1.3.4 rgsenergy

adds the PI column to the PIXELS table of the intermediate event lists.

#### 1.3.5 rgsbadpix

adds the two node-specific BADPIXn tables to the intermediate event lists.

#### 1.3.6 rgsevents

adds the EVNETS and REJPIXn tables to the intermediate event lists along with an index of event associations in the PIXELS table.

#### 1.3.7 evlistcomb

Create the combined event list from the set of intermediate event lists for one exposure.

### 2. Stage Two: "angles"
