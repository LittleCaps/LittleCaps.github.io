# Introduction

The RGS is best suited for high spectral resolution (from 100 to 500, FWHM) X-ray spectroscopy in the energy range 0.33-2.5 keV or 5-38 $\AA$[<sup>1</sup>](#refer-anchor). 

# Instrument description

There are two identical RGSs behind two of the three mirror assemblies [<sup>2</sup>](#refer-anchor). Fig .1 shows the optical design of the RGS.

## RFC chip arrays

There is inter chip gap between adjacent CCDs. The dispersion direction is along the spacecrafts -Z axis. Higher energies, shorter wavelengths, are disperderd to higher values in Z and to lower dispersion angles.

# Position Angle

The Definition of **position angle** of RGS is "the astronomical position angle gives the angular distance of the RGS dispersion axis measured from the celestial North towards East".
